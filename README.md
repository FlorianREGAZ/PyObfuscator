# PyObfuscator

Make your code difficult to understand and read. Minimize exposure to attacks.

This is an educational project to learn more about the Abstract-Syntax-Tree library of python and to explore the possibilities you have with python obfuscation.

The project is still in an very early stage of development. It currently only works on very simple scripts, so use it at your own risk!

## Examples
test

## Planned Features
- Support for more complex code (classes, more operations etc.)
- Anti debugging method
- One line obfuscation
- many more..
